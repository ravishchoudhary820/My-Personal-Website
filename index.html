          <h1 id="about-section">About me</h1>
          <p>I am Arush Choudhary, an 11-year-old student at GD Goenka School in Agra, currently building my foundation as a developer and future entrepreneur. My journey into technology began with Python, and I have since expanded my toolkit to include HTML and CSS, which I use to bring my digital ideas to life. I believe that coding is more than just instructions for a computer; it is a universal language that allows me to solve problems and create platforms from scratch. Whether I am debugging a script or designing a layout, I am always focused on the logic and structure that make technology work efficiently.</p>
          <p>Beyond the world of screens and syntax, I dedicate my time to mastering a diverse range of disciplines that sharpen my mind and creativity. I am currently learning to play both the flute and the piano, finding a unique balance between the technical precision of music and the logical flow of code. Additionally, I am immersed in learning German, as I believe being multilingual is a vital skill for anyone looking to make a mark on the global stage. This combination of music, language, and logic helps me stay disciplined and prepared for the challenges of a fast-paced, modern world.</p>
          <p>My ultimate ambition is to move to New York City and establish myself as a successful businessman, though the exact nature of my future enterprise remains a mystery even to me. I am inspired by the intelligence and pack coordination of the wolf, which is why I prefer the strength of Siberian Huskies and Wolfdogs over smaller, typical pets. To me, the wolf represents the perfect blend of individual skill and team loyalty—traits I intend to carry into the boardroom one day. While I may not know what my first big product will be, I am confident that my background in technology and my love for strategy will lead me to create something totally awesome!!</p>

          <p>My portfolio of "personal work" technically began on January 19, 2015, in Didwana. However, the most significant project of my life has been navigating the unique challenges of being an Indian Air Force kid. Growing up in a defense family, I have continuously changed homes and schools, which meant losing my circle of friends and starting from scratch nearly every year. Rather than letting this hold me back, I treated every move as an opportunity to rebuild and excel. This resilience is reflected in my academic record; from 2nd to 6th grade, I consistently earned SOF Olympiad Gold Medals in Mathematics, Science, and General Knowledge, proving that I can achieve high-level results regardless of where I am stationed.</p>
          <p>In the digital space, my work focuses on mastering the languages of the future: Python, HTML, and CSS. While I have spent the last few years building private projects and honing my logic, I am now moving into the competitive phase of my journey. This year, I am preparing for Codeavour International, marking my shift from a student to a global competitor. My personal work also extends to my school community at GD Goenka, Agra, where I have secured awards in IT Fests, Spelling Bees, and athletic events like the relay race and long jump. I view every trophy and every line of code as a building block for the large-scale portfolio I plan to complete by the time I reach college.</p> 
          <p>Beyond the technical and academic, I believe that a successful businessman must be well-rounded and culturally aware. This is why my personal development includes learning German and mastering both the flute and piano. Even my downtime is curated; I stay inspired by the storytelling on Netflix and the global trends on Spotify. I am particularly drawn to the intelligence and pack coordination of wolves, which is why I prefer the company of Siberian Huskies and Wolfdogs. To me, these animals represent the perfect balance of individual strength and team strategy. Every skill I acquire is a step toward my goal of moving to New York City to launch a business that is as coordinated and powerful as a wolf pack.</p>
